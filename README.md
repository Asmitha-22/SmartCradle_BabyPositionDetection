INTRODUCTION

Infant safety during sleep is a major concern for parents, as risks can arise unexpectedly.
Traditional baby monitors rely on constant human attention, which isn't always reliable.
The Smart Cradle System offers a smarter, proactive solution for infant monitoring.
It uses computer vision and machine learning to detect unsafe sleep positions and movements.
When danger is detected, the system sends real-time alerts to parents or caregivers.
Raspberry Pi and a camera module form the core of this cost-effective setup.
The system offers both video monitoring and automatic risk detection.
A two-way audio feature lets parents communicate with the infant remotely.
It can integrate with smart home devices for added convenience and control.
This system enhances infant safety and provides parents with peace of mind.
