ABSTRACT

The Smart Cradle System with Camera for Infants enhances baby safety during sleep.
It uses a camera and machine learning to monitor infant movements and sleep positions.
The system detects risks like suffocation or improper positioning in real-time.
Parents receive instant alerts for quick action through a mobile app or web interface.
The system adapts over time, improving its detection accuracy using machine learning.
It integrates with other smart home devices for a seamless experience.
Built with Python, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi 3, and a Pi Camera for reliable performance.
All video feeds and data are secured to protect family privacy.
This system gives parents peace of mind by creating a safer sleep environment for infants.

INTRODUCTION

Infant safety during sleep is a major concern for parents, as risks can arise unexpectedly.
Traditional baby monitors rely on constant human attention, which isn't always reliable.
The Smart Cradle System offers a smarter, proactive solution for infant monitoring.
It uses computer vision and machine learning to detect unsafe sleep positions and movements.
When danger is detected, the system sends real-time alerts to parents or caregivers.
Raspberry Pi and a camera module form the core of this cost-effective setup.
The system offers both video monitoring and automatic risk detection.
A two-way audio feature lets parents communicate with the infant remotely.
It can integrate with smart home devices for added convenience and control.
This system enhances infant safety and provides parents with peace of mind.

SCOPE

The Smart Cradle System improves infant safety through real-time monitoring.
It uses a Raspberry Pi Camera and machine learning to analyze sleep posture and movement.
The system detects risks like suffocation or improper positions and sends instant alerts.
Parents can monitor and receive notifications via a mobile or web interface.
A two-way audio feature allows remote soothing of the infant.
It integrates with smart home devices for added convenience and control.
The project aims to reduce sleep-related incidents and promote safe infant care.
